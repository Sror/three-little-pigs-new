	  		<p class="fading_text">Then along came the Wolf and said, "Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in."</p>

			<p class="fading_text">"No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin."</p>
			
			<p class="fading_text">"Then I'll puff and I'll huff, and I'll blow your house in!" So he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and he huffed, and at last he blew the house down, and ate up the second little Pig.</p>
