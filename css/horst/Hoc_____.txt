Horst Caps is a font that was named after a former student of mine from Stanford University, simply because I CAN, and because I no longer teach there.  It is in the Art Nouveau style, and consists of a set of script capital letters with fairly substantial curly-Q's. This version supplants an earlier version that lacked I, X and Y.

Like, Horst Caps is another one of those totally radical cool neat gnarly bite the big one boy do I have to go to the bathroom now thingies from the really weird but oh so hip not a dry pair of pants in the house dudes at Bug-Bytes, somewhere in the middle of Massachusetts, where they keep all the trees and lakes and where the mosquitoes for everywhere else originate.
